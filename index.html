# Welcome!

My name is Johan Björk and you have arrived at my résumé. I was born in 1991
and have been interested in software for most of my life. Software and automation
fascinates me; it can help us build cool stuff but it's mainly a huge time-saver
for boring and tedious tasks. Today I work as a self-employed computer programmer.

I am not entirely self-taught but 95% of what I know has been learnt by doing. I
value independence, accountability and pragmatic solutions. I'm a fan of compiled
languages, strong type systems and good error messages. I aim for my code to be readable,
well commented and tested (when that's a requirement). Long function and argument
names make me smile.

My professional experience is fairly wide and I would consider myself a generalist. Most
of my time over the last 10 years has been spent writing C#, PHP, TypeScript and SQL. I
am well-versed in Linux and Windows but I prefer to develop on MacOS. My view of operating
systems and programming languages is that they are merely tools - a good programmer should
be able to use whatever is necessary to deliver value.

In my spare time I enjoy playing badminton, cycling, cooking and playing the occasional
platforming video game. I'm a huge fan of chocolate and black liquorice. I live in the
Stockholm area. You may contact me at "**johan** at **imp** dot **pm**".

## Professional experience

- 2017-2021: Lead developer at the logistics firm YSDS AB. Me and my team developed and
maintanted an appplication for placing orders, tracking packages, invoicing and accounting.

- 2014-2017: Developer at Vinnia AB. I worked as a sub-contractor for this small firm
with a wide variety of customers. During my time here I built a time management application,
a couple of integrations with Upsales, Fortnox, Milltime and more.

- 2014-today: Developer at Reduca AB. Developed an application for housing
cooperatives (swedish "bostadsrättsförening") from the ground up. The application includes
document management, event scheduling, reminders, polls, electronic document signatures,
a meeting wizard and much more. This is a recurring customer of mine so I still work with them
from time to time.

- 2010-2012: Developer at Karl Björks Förlag HB. I built an application with order & invoice
management for a small publishing company. The application is still used today.
